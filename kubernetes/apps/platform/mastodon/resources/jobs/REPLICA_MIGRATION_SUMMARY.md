# Replica-Based Migration Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete replica-based migration implementation for migrating from Zalando PostgreSQL to CloudNative-PG using streaming replication. This approach reduces downtime from **5-15 minutes (pg_dump/restore) to 30 seconds - 2 minutes**.

## Files Created

### Documentation
- **REPLICA_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive 490-line guide covering all migration phases
  - Prerequisites and preparation steps
  - Phase-by-phase execution instructions
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Rollback procedures
  - Success criteria and monitoring

### Kubernetes Jobs

#### Phase 1: Preparation (No Downtime)
1. **replica-migration-prepare-zalando.yaml** (311 lines)
   - Creates `streaming_replica` user in Zalando with REPLICATION privilege
   - Generates secure password and stores in secret
   - Validates user creation and privileges
   - Includes RBAC (ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding)

2. **replica-migration-extract-certs.yaml** (280 lines)
   - Extracts TLS certificates from Zalando secrets
   - Creates CNPG-compatible secrets:
     - `zalando-replication-tls` (client cert + key)
     - `zalando-replication-ca` (CA certificate)
   - Validates certificate expiry and authenticity
   - Idempotent design

3. **replica-migration-validate-replication.yaml** (already existed)
   - Checks replication lag (should be < 5 seconds)
   - Compares LSN between Zalando and CNPG
   - Validates row counts for 7 key tables
   - Verifies replication slot status
   - Provides go/no-go decision for cutover

#### Phase 2: Cutover (30s-2min Downtime)
4. **replica-migration-cutover.yaml** (571 lines)
   - 8-step orchestration process:
     1. Record current replica counts
     2. Scale down all applications
     3. Wait for replication catchup (lag < 1s)
     4. Promote CNPG to primary
     5. Verify promotion success
     6. Verify configuration
     7. Scale up applications
     8. Validate health
   - Automatic rollback on failure (pre-promotion)
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - State persistence via ConfigMaps
   - RBAC with deployment scaling permissions

### Cluster Configuration
5. **database-cluster-replica.yaml** (185 lines)
   - CNPG Cluster configured for replica mode
   - Bootstrap via `pg_basebackup` from Zalando
   - Streaming replication configuration
   - External cluster connection parameters
   - Preserves all settings from original cluster
   - ScheduledBackup commented out (enable after promotion)

### Kustomization Updates
6. **kustomization.yaml** (updated)
   - Added documentation for replica-based migration jobs
   - Organized by migration phase
   - Clear usage instructions

## Migration Approach

### Physical Replication (pg_basebackup + Streaming)

**How it works:**
```
Zalando Primary ──streaming──▶ CNPG Replica (read-only)
                 replication

       ↓ (cutover: promote CNPG)

Zalando (deprecated) ╳        CNPG Primary (read-write)
                               ↑
                          Applications
```

**Key advantages:**
- ✅ Binary-exact copy (no schema issues)
- ✅ Continuous replication until cutover
- ✅ Minimal Zalando changes (no restart)
- ✅ Easy rollback before promotion
- ✅ 60-80% downtime reduction

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (0 downtime)
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

1. Create streaming_replica user (2-5 min)
2. Extract TLS certificates (1-2 min)
3. Deploy CNPG as replica (20-40 min for initial sync)
4. Validate replication (5 min)

**Rollback:** Easy - just delete CNPG cluster

### Phase 2: Cutover (30s-2min downtime)
**Duration:** 30 seconds - 2 minutes

1. Scale down apps (15-30s)
2. Wait for replication catchup (0-10s)
3. Promote CNPG (10-15s)
4. Scale up apps (30-60s)

**Rollback:**
- Before promotion: Automatic via orchestration job
- After promotion: Manual (requires recreating CNPG replica)

### Phase 3: Stabilization (no additional downtime)
**Duration:** 24-48 hours monitoring

1. Validate application health
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Verify backups
4. Check for errors

**Rollback:** Not recommended after 24h (data divergence risk)

### Phase 4: Cleanup (after 7+ days)
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

1. Verify CNPG stability
2. Scale down Zalando pooler
3. Delete Zalando cluster
4. Remove old secrets

## Prerequisites

### Version Requirements
- ✅ PostgreSQL 17 on both Zalando and CNPG (requirement met)
- ✅ Network connectivity between clusters
- ✅ Sufficient storage (40Gi data, 10Gi WAL)

### Access Requirements
- Cluster admin access
- Ability to scale deployments
- Database admin access (postgres user)
- S3 access for backups

### RBAC Resources Created
- `replica-migration-sa` - ServiceAccount for Zalando prep
- `mastodon-cert-extractor-sa` - ServiceAccount for cert extraction
- `cutover-orchestrator` - ServiceAccount for cutover orchestration
- Corresponding Roles and RoleBindings

## Security Considerations

### TLS Configuration
- SSL certificate verification (`sslmode: verify-full`)
- Client certificate authentication
- CA certificate validation
- Certificate expiry monitoring

### Secrets Management
- `zalando-streaming-replica` - Replication user credentials
- `zalando-replication-tls` - Client certificate and key
- `zalando-replication-ca` - CA certificate
- Secure password generation (25-character random)

### RBAC Permissions
- Minimal permissions per ServiceAccount
- No cluster-wide access
- Scoped to mastodon namespace
- Read-only where possible

## Monitoring and Validation

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Replication lag** (should be < 1 second)
- **LSN progression** (verify not stuck)
- **Row count consistency** (7 key tables)
- **Replication slot status** (active/inactive)
- **Connection counts** (before/after cutover)
- **Application health** (pod restarts, errors)

### Validation Points
1. **Pre-cutover:** Replication healthy for 24h
2. **During cutover:** Lag < 1s before promotion
3. **Post-cutover:** Applications connect successfully
4. **24h stability:** No incidents or errors
5. **7d stability:** Ready for Zalando cleanup

## Comparison with pg_dump Approach

| Aspect | pg_dump/restore | Replica-based |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Downtime** | 5-15 minutes | 30s - 2 minutes |
| **Zalando changes** | None | Add replication user |
| **Preparation time** | Minimal | 30-60 minutes |
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium |
| **Rollback ease** | Easy | Easy (pre-promotion) |
| **Data fidelity** | Schema-dependent | Binary-exact |
| **Risk** | Low | Low-Medium |

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start

```bash
# Phase 1: Preparation (no downtime)
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/apps/platform/mastodon/resources/jobs/replica-migration-prepare-zalando.yaml
kubectl create job prep-zalando-$(date +%Y%m%d) --from=job/replica-migration-prepare-zalando -n mastodon

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/apps/platform/mastodon/resources/jobs/replica-migration-extract-certs.yaml
kubectl create job extract-certs-$(date +%Y%m%d) --from=job/replica-migration-extract-certs -n mastodon

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/apps/platform/mastodon/resources/workloads/database-cluster-replica.yaml
# Wait 20-40 minutes for initial sync

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/apps/platform/mastodon/resources/jobs/replica-migration-validate-replication.yaml
kubectl create job validate-repl-$(date +%Y%m%d) --from=job/replica-migration-validate-replication -n mastodon

# Phase 2: Cutover (30s-2min downtime)
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/apps/platform/mastodon/resources/jobs/replica-migration-cutover.yaml
kubectl create job cutover-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M) --from=job/replica-migration-cutover -n mastodon

# Monitor cutover
kubectl logs -f job/cutover-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M) -n mastodon

# Phase 3: Validation (no downtime)
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/apps/platform/mastodon/resources/jobs/cnpg-validation-job.yaml
kubectl create job validate-cnpg-$(date +%Y%m%d) --from=job/cnpg-validation-job -n mastodon
```

### Emergency Rollback

```bash
# During preparation (before cutover)
kubectl delete cluster database -n mastodon
# Applications continue using Zalando

# During cutover (if job fails)
kubectl delete job cutover-* -n mastodon
# Check ConfigMap for saved replica counts
kubectl get configmap cutover-replica-counts -n mastodon -o yaml
# Manually restore deployments
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **pg_basebackup fails**
   - Check connectivity: `pg_isready -h mastodon-postgresql-rw`
   - Verify streaming_replica user exists
   - Check TLS certificates are valid

2. **High replication lag**
   - Reduce load on Zalando temporarily
   - Increase CNPG resources during initial sync
   - Check network latency

3. **Cutover fails during promotion**
   - Try manual promotion: `kubectl cnpg promote database`
   - Check CNPG cluster status
   - Review logs for errors

4. **Applications can't connect after cutover**
   - Verify pooler is running
   - Check DB_HOST configuration
   - Test connectivity from application pod

## Success Criteria

### Immediate (Cutover Completion)
- ✅ Cutover job completes without errors
